# HOUSE PREDICTION ANALYSIS
## Introduction
The project described below was done with the aim of using regression to create a house prediction model.

## Project Description

A real estate agency wants to maximize it's profits by being able to accurately predict house prices despite the rampant house fluctuations plaguing the real estate sector.

From the data provided, a house prediction model was created to help the agency minimize it's losses and maximize on the profits made.
## Experimental Design
1. Data sourcing/loading
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Univariate Analysis
5. Bivariate Analysis
6. Modelling
7. Conclusion
8. Recommendations

### Success Criteria
Creation of a model with high accuracy.
### Dataset
The dataset availed by the school.




# Conclusion
1. Features such as condition , bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living15 and sqft_living of the house should be put into consideration because they affect prices positively .

# Recommendations
1. The project was a success as a model with an accuracy of 67% was created. This model will help the agency in predicting house prices.
2. The agency should advice  homeowners to improve features such as waterfront, view as they have a great impact to the house prices.
3. To further improve the results of this project, other factors that might affect house prices should be analyzed. These factors include:
* The year the house was initially built (yr_built)
* Square footage of the land space (sqft_lot)
* The square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level (sqft_basement)
